Welcome to PineappleDevelopment's Official Blog!

I don't really yet know what we will be writing about here. But, if I ever have things on my mind I will write a blog about it. Who knows maybe Ebic will make a blog if he is bored too.

Anyways I've spent time upgrading my docs website now we officially have a logo. Granted this is subject to change over time, but I'm content with it as of now. If you want to learn about PineappleLib you can check that out [here](/pineapple-lib).

Here is our logo
